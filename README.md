Magic-8-Ball project using HTML5/CSS/Javascript

Using Skillcrush's instructions, I coded a working Magic-8-Ball integrating HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.  The Magic-8-Ball has a pop up window
in which the user inputs his or her question. The Ball then returns the answer with the image turning around to show the answer in the triangle 
in the middle of the Ball. The project showed a fun and creative way to use Javascript.
